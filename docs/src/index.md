## Introduction

G25Tools is a library for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
programming language to work with G25 coordinates.

G25 coordinates were introduced by the blogger
[Davidski](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/07/getting-most-out-of-global25_12.html)
to compare genetic samples and populations.

## First steps

1. Download the [main file of ancient samples](https://www.exploreyourdna.com/ancient-samples.aspx)
   from ExploreYourDNA.
2. I also highly recommend to get your G25 coordinates from
   [G25 Requests](https://g25requests.app/). 
   If you already know your K36 coordinates you can also begin
   with simulated G25 coordinates from
   [ExploreYourDNA](https://www.exploreyourdna.com/simulated-g25.aspx).
   Note that this step is not necessary to get the examples running.
3. Start working with the [examples](https://github.com/yogischogi/G25Tools.jl/tree/main/examples).
