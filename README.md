# G25Tools.jl

G25Tools is a library for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
programming language to work with G25 coordinates.

G25 coordinates were introduced by the blogger
[Davidski](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/07/getting-most-out-of-global25_12.html)
to compare genetic samples and populations. They have become
increasingly popular in recent years and are also used by
several companies.

For users there are several online calculators available at
[ExploreYourDNA](https://www.exploreyourdna.com/calculators.aspx)
but compared to a programming language their use is rather restricted.

G25Tools gives you more freedom to play around with DNA results
and allows for more in-depth exploration. You can:

1. Compare genetic samples and populations.
2. Filter existing samples to create new populations.
3. Generate simple PCA plots (PCA = Principal Component Analysis).

### Installation

You can install G25Tools from the Julia interpreter.

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/yogischogi/G25Tools.jl
pkg> Press BACKSPACE
